# 📘 Positional Encoding – Complete Guide (Transformer Models)

## 📌 Overview

This project provides a **complete, step-by-step implementation of Positional Encoding** used in **Transformer-based models** such as **BERT, GPT, and Vision Transformers**.

Transformers do not inherently understand the order of tokens in a sequence. **Positional Encoding** solves this problem by injecting **sequence order information** into token embeddings.

This repository includes:

* Conceptual explanation
* Sinusoidal positional encoding
* Learned positional encoding
* Visualization
* PyTorch implementation
* Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) for easy understanding

---

## 🧠 Why Positional Encoding?

Unlike RNNs or LSTMs, Transformers process all tokens **in parallel**, so they lose information about word order.

Example:

```
"Dog bites man"
"Man bites dog"
```

Without positional information, both sentences look the same to the model.

➡️ **Positional Encoding adds position awareness to embeddings.**

---

## 🧩 What Is Positional Encoding?

Positional Encoding adds a **position-specific vector** to each token embedding.

**Final Input to Transformer:**

```
Final Embedding = Word Embedding + Positional Encoding
```

## 🧪 Types of Positional Encoding Implemented

### 1️⃣ Sinusoidal Positional Encoding

* Introduced in the original Transformer paper
* Uses sine and cosine functions
* Fixed (not learned)
* Generalizes well to longer sequences

### 2️⃣ Learned Positional Encoding

* Used in models like BERT and GPT
* Position embeddings are learned during training
* Simple and effective
