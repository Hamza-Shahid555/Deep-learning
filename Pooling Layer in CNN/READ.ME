# Pooling Layer in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This document explains the **Pooling Layer**, its purpose, and how **Max Pooling** works.

---

## 1. What is a Pooling Layer?

A **Pooling Layer** reduces the **spatial size (width and height)** of feature maps while keeping important information.

In simple words:
> Pooling = Downsampling the feature map

---

## 2. Why Pooling is Used

Pooling layers help to:
- Reduce computational cost
- Reduce overfitting
- Make the model more robust to small shifts (translation invariance)
- Extract the most important features

## 3. Types of Pooling

### a) Max Pooling
Selects the **maximum value** from a region.

### b) Average Pooling
Selects the **average value** from a region.

### c) Global Pooling
Reduces the entire feature map into a **single value per channel**.

---

## 4. What is Max Pooling?

**Max Pooling** takes the **largest value** from each window of the feature map.

### Example

Input Feature Map (4×4):
