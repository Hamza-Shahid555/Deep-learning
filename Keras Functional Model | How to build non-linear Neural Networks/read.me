The Keras Functional API allows you to build complex and non-linear neural network architectures that are not possible using the Sequential API.
It is ideal for models with multiple inputs, multiple outputs, shared layers, skip connections, and branching structures.

This project demonstrates how to design and train non-linear neural networks using the Functional API in Keras with clear, modular architecture.

Why Use the Functional API?

Supports non-linear (graph-based) model architectures

Enables multiple inputs & outputs

Allows layer sharing

Ideal for advanced deep learning models

More flexible than Sequential
