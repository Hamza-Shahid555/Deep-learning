# Deep Computer Vision with CNNs

## 📌 Overview

Deep Computer Vision focuses on enabling machines to **see, understand, and interpret visual data** such as images and videos. The backbone of modern computer vision is the **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** — a deep learning architecture specifically designed to process visual information.

CNNs automatically learn **spatial hierarchies of features**, from simple edges to complex objects, making them extremely powerful for vision tasks.

## 🧠 Why CNNs for Computer Vision?

Traditional machine learning required **manual feature extraction** (edges, textures, shapes). CNNs remove this burden by learning features **automatically**.

### Key Advantages:

* Parameter sharing (fewer weights)
* Spatial locality (focus on nearby pixels)
* Translation invariance
* High accuracy on visual tasks

## 🏗️ Basic Architecture of a CNN

A typical CNN consists of the following layers:

### 1️⃣ Convolutional Layer

* Applies filters (kernels) to the input image
* Extracts features like edges, corners, textures
* Output is called a **feature map**

📐 Example: 3×3 filter sliding over an image

---

### 2️⃣ Activation Function (ReLU)

* Introduces non-linearity
* ReLU(x) = max(0, x)
* Helps the network learn complex patterns

---

### 3️⃣ Pooling Layer

* Reduces spatial dimensions
* Common types:

  * Max Pooling
  * Average Pooling
* Improves computation speed and prevents overfitting

---

### 4️⃣ Fully Connected (Dense) Layer

* Flattens feature maps into a vector
* Performs final classification or regression

---

### 5️⃣ Output Layer

* Uses:

  * **Softmax** for multi-class classification
  * **Sigmoid** for binary classification
