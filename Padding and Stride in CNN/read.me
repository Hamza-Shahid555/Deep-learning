# Padding and Stride in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This document explains the concepts of **Padding** and **Stride**, two important hyperparameters used in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

---

## 1. What is Padding?

**Padding** is the process of adding extra pixels (usually zeros) around the border of an input image.

### Why Padding is Used
- To preserve spatial dimensions of the input.
- To prevent loss of information at the edges.
- To allow deeper networks.

### Types of Padding
- **Valid Padding** → No padding is added.
- **Same Padding** → Output size is same as input size.
- **Zero Padding** → Borders filled with zeros.

### Example

Input Size: `5 × 5`  
Filter Size: `3 × 3`  
Padding: `1`

Output becomes:  

# Stride in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This document explains the concept of **Stride** in a simple and easy-to-remember way.

## 1. What is Stride?

**Stride** is the number of pixels the filter (kernel) moves each time it slides across the input image.

In simple words:
> Stride = Step size of the filter movement

---

## 2. Why is Stride Important?

Stride helps to:
- Control the size of the output feature map
- Reduce computational cost
- Perform downsampling in CNNs

---

## 3. How Stride Works

When the filter moves across the image:
- **Stride = 1** → moves 1 pixel at a time (more detailed scanning)
- **Stride = 2** → moves 2 pixels at a time (faster, less detailed)

---

## 4. Example

**Input size:** `5 × 5`  
**Filter size:** `3 × 3`

| Stride | Output Size |
|--------|------------|
| 1      | 3 × 3      |
| 2      | 2 × 2      |

---

## 5. Output Size Formula

\[
\text{Output Size} = \frac{(N - F)}{S} + 1
\]

Where:
- **N** = Input size
- **F** = Filter size
- **S** = Stride
