# Custom Models and Training with TensorFlow 🧠

This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook exploring advanced TensorFlow mechanics and the customization of the Keras API. It serves as a practical guide and solution set for Chapter 12 of *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow*.

The focus is on breaking out of the standard Keras API to build custom components, essential for developing novel AI architectures and Autonomous Agents.

## 📂 Content Overview

The notebook `12_custom_models_and_training_with_tensorflow.ipynb` covers the following core topics:

### 1. Low-Level TensorFlow API
- **Tensors & Operations:** Manipulating tensors similarly to NumPy arrays.
- **Data Structures:** Working with Strings, Ragged Tensors, Sparse Tensors, Sets, and Queues.
- **Variables:** Managing state with `tf.Variable`.

### 2. Custom Keras Components
- **Custom Loss Functions:** Implementation of the **Huber Loss** function (with and without threshold hyperparameters).
- **Custom Metrics:** Creating streaming metrics (stateful) for precise evaluation.
- **Custom Layers:**
  - Building layers with learnable weights (`add_weight`).
  - Handling multiple inputs/outputs.
  - Differentiating behavior between training and inference (e.g., `MyGaussianNoise`).
- **Custom Models:** Implementing complex architectures like **Residual Blocks** and **ResNet** components using the Subclassing API.

### 3. Advanced Training Mechanics
- **Automatic Differentiation:** Utilizing `tf.GradientTape` to compute gradients manually.
- **Custom Training Loops:** Writing raw training loops from scratch (bypassing `model.fit()`) using optimizers and gradients.
- **TensorFlow Functions:** Optimizing Python functions into efficient computation graphs using `@tf.function` and AutoGraph.

## 🛠️ Key Exercises & Solutions

This notebook includes solutions to complex implementation exercises:

* **Custom Layer Normalization:** A manual implementation of Layer Normalization matching the behavior of `tf.keras.layers.LayerNormalization`.
* **Fashion MNIST Custom Loop:** A full training loop implementation for the Fashion MNIST dataset, including:
    * Dynamic progress bars.
    * Step-by-step gradient descent.
    * Dual optimizers (different learning rates for upper vs. lower layers).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed (Python 3.7+):

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn tqdm
